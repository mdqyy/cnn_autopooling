cnn_autopooling
===============

Implementation of a convolutional neural network (CNN) which uses sorting layers and an automatically learned pooling function instead of hard coded pooling functions (such as max, average, stochastic pooling).

The base code is based on this Matlab CNN library by Mikhail Sirotenko: http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/24291-cnn-convolutional-neural-network-class
